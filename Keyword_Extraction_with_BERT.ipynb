BERT is an unmatched tool showing an admiringly well performance for keyword/keyphrase extraction tasks. We will use BERT to extract good quality keyphrases from highly rank ads which can be used to generate more ads of optimum quality. The quality of the ad is indicated by the rank provided by Google to that particular ad.         "
